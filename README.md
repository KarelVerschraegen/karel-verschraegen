# Welcome!

## Technologies

This site is built with
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Remix](https://remix.run/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org/)

and hosted on
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

## Getting started

From your terminal:

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

To start the project in development mode.

## Deployment

If you want to build and serve the website in production mode locally:

```sh
pnpm run build && pnpm run start
```

The Vercel integration automatically deploys all code on the `master` branch to the production environment.

If you want to create a preview branch before pushing your code to production, you can create a new branch and Vercel will automatically create a testing environment.

```sh
git checkout -b my_new_branch

git push
```
